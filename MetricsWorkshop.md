# Metrics Workshop

## Goal

To understand the need for, and plan to collect various metrics related to the cloud migration in the Beta phase.

## Process

Conduct a cross-functional workshop:

Introduce the team to the standard metrics that will be tracked during the Beta phase.

Roll in the metrics that were identified during the post-Alpha retrospective.

Prioritize, as a team, which ones should be tracked (it is likely not feasible to track all of them).

In addition, ask the following questions:

* What does each of you need to track to do your job?
* What does it take to measure this?

## Deliverables

A list of metrics to be tracked during the Beta phase, and a process for doing so. A list of tools configured, used is also likely to come out of this.
