# Post-Alpha Phase Retrospective

## Goal

Get-together and talk about how the Alpha phase went. The goal here is not to assign blame, but to figure out how to work better together.

## Process

Conduct two retrospectives, one with leadership only, and one with the cross-functional Alpha phase team.

Begin with general questions about the Alpha phase:

* What went well during the Alpha phase?
* What went wrong during the Alpha phase?
* What could we do differently to improve?

Discuss some questions specifically about the migration:

* What parts of the cloud architecture need to be re-thought?
* Did the roles and responsibilities established work in practice?
* Did the channels and frequency of communications work for everyone?
* What are some knowledge gaps? What do you need to document and where?
* What tools do you need?
* What things can we measure during the next phase to ensure success?

## Deliverables

A list of things the team is going to do in the next phase to work better together. A list of candidate metrics to measure in the Beta phase.
